Willey bowls four dots in a row to Kohli, who looks to break free by holes out to the fielder at mid-on.A big blow for India as Kohli walks back after a nine-ball duck.The wicket came on the back of some terrific bowling from the two England pacers.They conceded just a single in the last 16 balls and Kohli wanted to break the shackles but ended up paying the price. He uses his feet looking to loft it down the ground but ends up miscuing a simple catch to Stokes at mid-off.Dawid Malans superb fielding off the previous delivery also played a part as he came up with a diving stop in the covers to save the boundary.Shreyas Iyer gets off the mark with a quick single off the last ball.In the next over, Shreyas gets a leading edge looking to clip Woakes on the leg side but the ball falls safely on the off-side.Rohit offers no shot to the incoming delivery which strikes him high on the thigh pads ruling on the LBW.Rohit comes down the track and swings across the line as he gets it off the inside half of the bat for a couple of runs.Willey continues as Shreyas defends the first few balls before he attempts a quick single but decides against it.&nbsp;Shreyas had hit the ball into the covers with Malan coming up with a half stop before Stokes swooped in quickly and Rohit had to rush back to his crease.Shreyas keeps out the last ball as Willey bowls his second maiden over.India have two wickets for nine runs in the last six overs.A bit of luck for Rohit as he tries to cut Woakes but gets the edge which flies over the slip fielder for a four.India are 35/2 in 10 overs with Rohit on 24 from 30 balls and Shreyas on two.\"\n",

      "\t\t\t\"articleBody\":\"Welcome to the coverage of the World Cup 2023 match between India and England in Lucknow on Sunday.India and England have played with contrasting approaches in the World Cup so far, producing contrasting results. India are on course to top the league stage while England are looking to survive in the tournament they won four years ago.The Rohit Sharma-led side has hardly put a foot wrong, having chased successfully for five games in a row.England set the benchmark in white-ball cricket with their aggressive style of play, resulting in global triumphs in both the shorter formats.However, the boom or bust approach has clearly not worked in Indian conditions and the defending champions find themselves on the brink of an embarrassing exit.&nbsp;Compared to England, India have very little to worry about though they will be missing the all-round services of Hardik Pandya for at least the next couple of games.In the usual scenario, Ravichandran Ashwin would have replaced Shardul Thakur on a pitch that is likely to assist the spinners. However, Hardiks absence forces the team management to play only five bowlers.Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja walk into the combination for Sundays game.To accommodate Ashwin as the third spinner, India will have to choose between Mohammad Siraj and Mohammed Shami, who asserted his world-class credentials with five wickets in Dharamsala.&nbsp;In Hardiks absence, Suryakumar Yadav is the teams choice at number six. Following an unfortunate run-out in his first game of the competition, he will be itching to make an impact.The chatter on Shreyas Iyers perpetual struggles against the short-ball has resumed following his dismissal in Dharamsala. He will be fired up to prove his doubters wrong.Shubman Gill, who missed the first couple of games due to dengue, is due for a special knock. The Lucknow crowd could also witness a record-equalling 49th hundred from Virat Kohli.Wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who is from Uttar Pradesh, will be looking to fox the England batters at the state-of-the-art stadium. It was a good test for him against the rampaging Daryl Mitchell and he will be ready for the England challenge.\"\n",

However, Hardik's absence forces the team management to play only five bowlers.</div><div><br></div><div>Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja walk into the combination for Sunday's game.</div><div><br></div><div>To accommodate Ashwin as the third spinner, India will have to choose between Mohammad Siraj and Mohammed Shami, who asserted his world-class credentials with five wickets in Dharamsala.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Hardik's absence, Suryakumar Yadav is the team's choice at number six. Following an unfortunate run-out in his first game of the competition, he will be itching to make an impact.</div><div><br></div><div>The chatter on Shreyas Iyer's perpetual struggles against the short-ball has resumed following his dismissal in Dharamsala. He will be fired up to prove his doubters wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>Shubman Gill, who missed the first couple of games due to dengue, is due for a special knock.

      "\t\t\t\"articleBody\":\"Welcome to the coverage of the World Cup 2023 match between India and England in Lucknow on Sunday.India and England have played with contrasting approaches in the World Cup so far, producing contrasting results. India are on course to top the league stage while England are looking to survive in the tournament they won four years ago.The Rohit Sharma-led side has hardly put a foot wrong, having chased successfully for five games in a row.England set the benchmark in white-ball cricket with their aggressive style of play, resulting in global triumphs in both the shorter formats.However, the boom or bust approach has clearly not worked in Indian conditions and the defending champions find themselves on the brink of an embarrassing exit.&nbsp;Compared to England, India have very little to worry about though they will be missing the all-round services of Hardik Pandya for at least the next couple of games.In the usual scenario, Ravichandran Ashwin would have replaced Shardul Thakur on a pitch that is likely to assist the spinners. However, Hardiks absence forces the team management to play only five bowlers.Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja walk into the combination for Sundays game.To accommodate Ashwin as the third spinner, India will have to choose between Mohammad Siraj and Mohammed Shami, who asserted his world-class credentials with five wickets in Dharamsala.&nbsp;In Hardiks absence, Suryakumar Yadav is the teams choice at number six. Following an unfortunate run-out in his first game of the competition, he will be itching to make an impact.The chatter on Shreyas Iyers perpetual struggles against the short-ball has resumed following his dismissal in Dharamsala. He will be fired up to prove his doubters wrong.Shubman Gill, who missed the first couple of games due to dengue, is due for a special knock. The Lucknow crowd could also witness a record-equalling 49th hundred from Virat Kohli.Wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who is from Uttar Pradesh, will be looking to fox the England batters at the state-of-the-art stadium. It was a good test for him against the rampaging Daryl Mitchell and he will be ready for the England challenge.\"\n",

However, Hardik's absence forces the team management to play only five bowlers.</div><div><br></div><div>Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja walk into the combination for Sunday's game.</div><div><br></div><div>To accommodate Ashwin as the third spinner, India will have to choose between Mohammad Siraj and Mohammed Shami, who asserted his world-class credentials with five wickets in Dharamsala.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Hardik's absence, Suryakumar Yadav is the team's choice at number six. Following an unfortunate run-out in his first game of the competition, he will be itching to make an impact.</div><div><br></div><div>The chatter on Shreyas Iyer's perpetual struggles against the short-ball has resumed following his dismissal in Dharamsala. He will be fired up to prove his doubters wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>Shubman Gill, who missed the first couple of games due to dengue, is due for a special knock. The Lucknow crowd could also witness a record-equalling 49th hundred from Virat Kohli.</div><div><br></div><div>Wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who is from Uttar Pradesh, will be looking to fox the England batters at the state-of-the-art stadium.
